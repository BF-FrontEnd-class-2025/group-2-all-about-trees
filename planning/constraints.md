# Constraints

Some boundaries around our project.

## External

- project deadlines: 2 days

- content availability: Images, videos, and diagrams might require permissions
  or licensing.

- technical issues: the website relies on working links to external resources,
  which may break or change.

- legal rules: must ensure images and content comply with copyright laws.
- dependence on others: relying on external organizations or resources could
  lead to delays if things change on their end

## Internal

- limited skills or team experience: the team may lack expertise in web design,
  development, or content creation.
- time constraints: the project has a tight deadline.
